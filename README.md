<b>A. Random Sample</b>

It is very important to master the Random Sample time series model thoroughly. There are three reasons for this:

1. Some real-world times series actually are Random Samples
2. Many other time series models have Random Samples hidden inside them
3. The rules for forecasting/explaining of time series depend upon how the Random Sample is hidden inside.

Validation of other time series usually means ferreting out how the Random Sample is hidden inside.

Thus, we look at the conditions that one needs to check to declare a time series as a Random Sample by answering a series of questions associated with the time series patterns of weekly sales (in $1000s) of two furniture manufacturers, lets call 'em Firm 1 & Firm 2.
